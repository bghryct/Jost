FONTLOG for Jost*
===================

This file includes information about the Jost* typeface by indestructible type*.


About
-----

Jost* is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired by 
the designs of Paul Renner. This is version 3.3.

Jost* is designed and maintained by Owen Earl (https://ewonrael.github.io/), 
who is the creator of the font foundry indestructible type* (http://indestructible-type.github.io).

Jost* is a font for the digital age. It's based off of the work of Paul Renner, the designer of Futura. 
Jost* is an original font that aims to keep the attitude of Futura rather than the exact design. Futura 
was designed to be functional in its day and in that spirit, Jost* aims to be as functional as possible 
in the digital era. For that reason it deviates from the exact designs of Paul Jost, favoring, for example, 
a larger x-height. It also includes features, many of which would not be possible in the era of Paul Jost.
Jost* has 9 weights, ranging from Hairline to Black. It can support many languages, includes stylistic 
alternatives, and both tabular and proportional numbers. Using Jost* on the web is as easy as copying a 
line of code into your webpage and includes automatic updates. As of version 3.0, Jost* supports OpenType 
Variable Font technology that allows users to control the exact weight and italic of the font. Best of all
Jost* is still being actively developed meaning it will continue to improve and future updates may include 
features requested by you! [Visit the website for more information!](http://indestructibletype.com/Jost)
